(** Sets over ordered types.

    This module implements the set data structure, given a total
    ordering function over the set elements. All operations over sets
    are purely applicative (no side-effects).  The implementation uses
    balanced binary trees, and is therefore reasonably efficient:
    insertion and membership take time logarithmic in the size of the
    set, for instance.

    {b Note} OCaml, Batteries Included, provides two implementations
    of sets: polymorphic sets (module {!PSet}) and functorized sets
    (this module). Module {!Set} offers a more complex and slightly
    poorer set of features but stronger type-safety. Module {!PSet} is
    easier to use and has a few more powerful features but makes it
    easier to shoot yourself in the foot. In case of doubt, use
    {!Set}.

      (** {6 Override modules}*)

    (**
       The following modules replace functions defined in {!Set} with functions
       behaving slightly differently but having the same name. This is by design:
       the functions meant to override the corresponding functions of {!Set}.
       
       To take advantage of these overrides, you probably want to
       {{:../extensions.html#multiopen}{open several modules in one
       operation}} or {{:../extensions.html#multialias}{alias several
       modules to one name}}. For instance, to open a version of {!Set}
       with exceptionless error management, you may write {v open Set,
       ExceptionLess v}. To locally replace module {!Set} with a module of
       the same name but with exceptionless error management, you may
       write {v module Set = Set include ExceptionLess v}.

    (** Operations on {!Set} with labels.
	
	This module overrides a number of functions of {!Set} by
	functions in which some arguments require labels. These labels are
	there to improve readability and safety and to let you change the
	order of arguments to functions. In every case, the behavior of the
	function is identical to that of the corresponding function of {!Set}.
