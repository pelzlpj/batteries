(** Association tables over ordered types.

   This module implements applicative association tables, also known as
   finite maps or dictionaries, given a total ordering function
   over the keys.
   All operations over maps are purely applicative (no side-effects).
   The implementation uses balanced binary trees, and therefore searching
   and insertion take time logarithmic in the size of the map.

       The following modules replace functions defined in {!Map} with functions

       the functions meant to override the corresponding functions of {!Map}.
       
       To take advantage of these overrides, you probably want to
       {{:../extensions.html#multiopen}{open several modules in one
       operation}} or {{:../extensions.html#multialias}{alias several
       modules to one name}}. For instance, to open a version of {!Map}
       with exceptionless error management, you may write {v open Map,
       ExceptionLess v}. To locally replace module {!Map} with a module of
       the same name but with exceptionless error management, you may
       write {v module Map = Map include ExceptionLess v}.
