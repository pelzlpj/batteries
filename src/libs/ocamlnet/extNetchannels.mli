(** TODO understand what to do with the .mli of this module. It
    extends ocamlnet's Netchannels, should we inline all the .mli of
    Netchannels or do we have a better solution for that? *)

(** Accumulator channel (meaningful for Netchannels built from
    Batteries output channels).

    Once an accumulator channel has been closed, the value it has
    accumulated during output can be retrieved using [# accumulator].

    [acc_oc :> rec_out_channel], where [acc_oc] is an
    [acc_out_channel] instance. *)
