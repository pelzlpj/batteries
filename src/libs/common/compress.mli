(** Common compression/decompression interfaces.

    This module provides abstract interfaces for manipulating
    compressed data. The interfaces are abstract in the sense that
    they are not specific of any underlying (de)compression
    libraries. Each of such library integrated with Batteries is
    required to implement the abstract interfaces. This way, switching
    from one compression library to another should be as easy as
    switching module name.

    Library-specific features can be provided by offering additional
    functions with respect to the common abstract interfaces.
