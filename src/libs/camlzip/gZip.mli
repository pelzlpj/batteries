(** GZip - compression/decompression interface.

    This module provide access to GZip compression and decompression
    functionalities. Both the common (de)compression interface
    (implemented by all compression libraries available via Batteries)
    and GZip-specific functionalities are accessible using this
    module.

(* XXX this should be a module include, but currently it does not work
   well with ocamldoc. Hence for the moment we copy&paste from
   Compress' .mli :-(
