(* XXX: it has to be checked how costly is wrapping each of the
arguments of IO.create_{in,out} with exception handlers is. Currently,
this is done for the sake of being sure that Compression_error is
always raised, and this is the only way to do that staying at the
OCaml level, because Zlib.Error is also raised from C bindings.

The only alternative is adding hooks into IO.create_{in,out} which let
specifying extensible exception handlers. *)
